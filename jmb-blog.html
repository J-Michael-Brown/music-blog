  <h1>
    I like Music
  </h1>
  <p> There's a insane amount of music you can listen to and most of it is awful.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Rock </li>
    <li> Classical </li>
    <li> Alternative </li>
    <li> Electonic </li>
    <li> Jazz </li>
    <li> Taylor Swift </li>
    <ul>
      <li> <em>with her magnum opus <strong> Bad Blood </strong> </em></li>
    </ul>
    <p> It doesn't matter if It's played on the radio one or one hundred times to many to know that you don't like it. If you find a song dissagreeable its easy to point at the creator of the piece and say they are untalented. It is an easy action to disregard an entire genre as flat and uniteresting, or dull and overdramatic. It is another thing all together to understand what makes music <em> good </em> to you. </p>
